 abstract = {A _$γ$-quasi-clique_ in a simple undirected graph refers to a subset of vertices that induces a subgraph with edge density at least $γ \ın [0,1]$. When $γ=1$, this definition corresponds to a classical clique. When $γ<1$, it relaxes the requirement of all possible edges by the clique  definition. Quasi-clique detection has been used in graph-based data mining to  find dense clusters, especially in large-scale error-prone data sets in which the clique model can be overly restrictive. The _maximum $γ$-quasi-clique problem_,  seeking a $γ$-quasi-clique of maximum cardinality in the given graph, can be formulated as an optimization problem with a linear objective function and a single quadratic constraint in binary variables. This article investigates the Lagrangian dual of this formulation, and develops an upper-bounding technique using the geometry of ellipsoids to bound the Lagrangian dual. The tightness of the upper-bound is compared to those obtained from multiple mixed-integer programming formulations of the problem via experiments on  benchmark instances.},
