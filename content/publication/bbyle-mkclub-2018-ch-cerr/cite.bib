 abstract = {This article provides an erratum to ``Finding a maximum $k$-club using the $k$-clique formulation and canonical hypercube cuts,'' published online in Optim Lett, 2015. Due to  programming errors in our C++ implementations, the computational results reported in the article are incorrect. In some pathological instances, a significantly larger number of $k$-cliques that are not $k$-clubs can be detected, which can  adversely affect the performance of the algorithms proposed. This erratum presents completely revised computational results, discussion, and conclusions that are meant to \emphreplace Sections~3 and~4 in the original article.
