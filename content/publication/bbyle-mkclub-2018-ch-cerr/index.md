abstract: "This article provides an erratum to "Finding a maximum $k$-club using the $k$-clique formulation and canonical hypercube cuts,"" published online in Optim Lett, 2015. Due to  programming errors in our C++ implementations, the computational results reported in the article are incorrect. In some pathological instances, a significantly larger number of $k$-cliques that are not $k$-clubs can be detected, which can  adversely affect the performance of the algorithms proposed. This erratum presents completely revised computational results, discussion, and conclusions that are meant to _replace_ Sections 3 and 4 in the original article."
