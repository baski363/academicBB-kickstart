 abstract = {A method for constructing test functions for global optimization which utilizes continuous formulations of combinatorial optimization problems is suggested. In particular, global optimization formulations for the maximum independent set, maximum clique, and MAX CUT problems on arbitrary graphs are considered, and proofs for some of them are given. A number of sample test functions based on these formulations are proposed.},
