 abstract = {This paper proposes clique relaxations to identify clusters in biological networks. In particular, the maximum $n$-clique and maximum $n$-club problems on an arbitrary graph are introduced and their recognition versions are shown to be NP-complete. In addition, integer programming formulations are proposed and the results of sample numerical experiments performed on biological networks are reported.},
