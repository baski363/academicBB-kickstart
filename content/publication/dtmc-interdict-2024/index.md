abstract: "We introduce a new variant of the network interdiction problem with a Markovian evader that randomly chooses a neighboring vertex in each step to build their path from designated source(s) to terminal(s). The interdictor's goal is to maximize the evader’s minimum expected _first passage time_. We establish sufficient conditions for the interdiction to not be counter-productive, prove that the problem is NP-hard, and demonstrate the model’s usefulness by solving a mixed-integer programming formulation on a test bed of social networks."
