abstract: "The analysis of social and biological networks often involves modeling clusters of interest as _cliques_ or their graph-theoretic generalizations. The _$k$-club model_, which relaxes the requirement of pairwise adjacency in a clique to length-bounded  paths inside the cluster, has been used to model cohesive subgroups in social networks and functional modules/complexes in biological networks. However, if the graphs  are time-varying, or if they change under different conditions, we may be interested in clusters that preserve their property over time or under changes in conditions.   To model such  clusters that are conserved in a collection of graphs, we consider a _cross-graph $k$-club_ model,  a subset of nodes that forms a $k$-club in every graph in the collection. In this paper, we consider the canonical optimization problem of finding a  cross-graph $k$-club of maximum cardinality. We introduce algorithmic ideas to  solve this problem and evaluate their performance on some benchmark  instances.
