abstract: "Detecting quasi-cliques in graphs is a useful tool for detecting dense clusters in graph-based data mining. Particularly in large-scale data sets that are  error-prone, cliques are overly restrictive and impractical. Quasi-clique detection has been accomplished using heuristic approaches  in various applications of graph-based data mining in protein interaction networks, gene co-expression networks,  and telecommunication networks. Quasi-cliques are not hereditary, in the sense that every subset of a quasi-clique need not be a quasi-clique. This lack of heredity introduces interesting challenges in the development of exact algorithms to detect maximum cardinality quasi-cliques. The only exact approaches for this problem are limited to two mixed integer programming formulations that were recently proposed in the literature. The main contribution of this article is  a new combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for the maximum quasi-clique problem."
