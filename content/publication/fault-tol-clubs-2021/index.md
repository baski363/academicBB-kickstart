abstract: "Cliques and their generalizations are frequently used to model \"tightly knit\" clusters in graphs and identifying such clusters is a popular technique used in graph-based data mining. One such model is the $s$-club, which is a vertex subset that induces a subgraph of diameter at most $s$. This model has found use in a variety of fields because  low-diameter clusters have practical significance  in many applications. As this property is not hereditary on vertex-induced subgraphs, the diameter of a subgraph could increase upon the removal of some vertices and  the subgraph could even become disconnected. For example, star graphs have  diameter  two but can be disconnected by removing the central vertex.
The pursuit of a fault-tolerant extension of the $s$-club model has  spawned  two variants that we study in this article: robust $s$-clubs  and hereditary $s$-clubs. We analyze the complexity of the  verification and optimization problems associated with these variants. Then, we propose cut-like integer programming formulations for both variants whenever possible and investigate the separation complexity of the cut-like constraints.  We demonstrate through our extensive computational experiments that the algorithmic ideas we introduce  enable us to solve the problems to optimality on benchmark instances with several thousand vertices. This work lays the foundations for  effective mathematical programming approaches for finding  fault-tolerant $s$-clubs in large-scale networks."
