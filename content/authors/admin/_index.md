I received my Ph.D in Industrial Engineering from Texas A&M University in 2007 and my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras in 2002. I am primarily interested in solving combinatorial optimization problems modeled on networks and applications of integer programming. This has led me into diverse domains including computational biology, social network analysis, and graph-based data mining, as well as classical areas of operations research like transportation logistics, production-inventory planning, and scheduling. 

My work has been sponsored by the NSF, DoE, AFOSR, and industry. Publications coauthored with my students and other collaborators have appeared in _Operations Research_, _INFORMS Journal on Computing_, _INFORMS Journal on Optimization_, and _INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics_, among others. I serve on the editorial boards of _Networks_ (Wiley) and _Journal of Global Optimization_ (Springer).
